Teriyaki Meatball Recipe Variations



* Add or swap the vegetables: This is a great recipe for using up any leftover vegetables in the fridge. Try chopped broccoli, carrots or red onion in place of (or in addition to) the veggies in the teriyaki and pineapple meatball recipe.
* Switch up the meat: You can easily swap the ground beef for ground turkey or chicken, if you prefer.
* Substitute spices: Try granulated onion flakes or onion powder, a pinch of red pepper flakes or freshly ground black pepper in either the meatballs or the sauce.
